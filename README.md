# Whispers of the Loop - Unity Prototype

Final Writeup
Can I show off your submission to future sections of the course? You can definitely show this off, I'm not sure why you would want to though, maybe if I put a couple weeks more effort into this.
Provide a link to a gameplay video of your project.Provide a link to where I can download your project (source code). 
What is the name of your game? The name of the game is "Whispers of the Loop" .
How is the game played? What are the controls?
The player is meant to be a glowing, ethereal spirit exploring a surreal, dreamlike world. The main goal is to collect scattered memory fragments hidden within landscapes by solving light reflection puzzles and navigating through obstacles and challenges. The world operates on a 60-second time loop; if a fragment isn't collected before time runs out, the environment resets. If a player succeeds, a random combination will begin again.
Based on the mechanics, the controls would typically involve:
Movement: Standard WASD keys for forward, backward, strafing left, and right.
Camera Look: Mouse movement for looking around (horizontal and vertical).
Jump: Spacebar.
Form Shift:‚ÄùQ‚Äù to switch between Light and Shadow forms.
Leave: L to leave the game
Force Reset: R to force Reset the Game
Write a brief summary of what you created (3-5 sentences)
"Whispers of the Loop" is a puzzle-platformer and atmospheric yet intrinsic exploration game. Players embody an ethereal spirit navigating a fragmented memory-scape meant to be filled with abstract architecture and unique obstacles. The core gameplay is exploring open spaces, combining light platforming/mirrors, and solving environmental puzzles redirecting light beams through reflections to advance and collect memory fragments. A unique time loop mechanic resets the world every minute if no progress is made, adding a layer of urgency and requiring players to try their best across loops. Locations are random with only a verification of plausible values meant to check for valid combinations. Furthermore, I didn't have time to focus on UI,  graphics, story/plot, sound, or anything but basic games. In a perfect world players would be able to learn personal psychology with every memory fragment collected when navigating and each level harder and more unique then the previous with terrain, axis, and obstacle/mirror implementation for fleshed out game. The game aims for an emotional, spatially open experience with subtle guidance and an immersive experience with neon accents and particle effects.

Are there any requirements you did not complete from the requirements section?
Start menuish
No Options Menu
Random Requirements kindofish
No nontrivial things üòÉ
Incomplete graphics not incomplete features
Runs consistently with fps w/o obvious bugs
0.25/1x as much work. A lot of work in the past week outdone my classmates, averaged out over the semester == bottom 10 if not 5
Summer Points yAY? (please my personal savior Samuel Ang i need these points dont take them away)
BOUNTES did nothing except for levels technically
I accept defeat turning it in alone was a victory; ONLY CAUSE I HAD NO TIME I WOULDA WENT CRAZY FOR THIS PROJECT IF I DIDNT TROLL THIS SUMMER SEMESTER SMH                
How many total points did you complete from the bounties section? 3 üòó
Please list out each bounty you completed along with individual point value. 
Levels (2 points) 
Interactable Objects (4 points)
(Colliders with effects (2 points)
(Procedurall generation) (10 points)
(Generate Objects with random Params) (5 points)
(particle system kinda didn't really create my own) (6 points)

(Unity‚Äôs Physics) (2 points)
(Puzzle?) (8 points)
(Dynamic Music should work)  (3 points)
(speedrunning timer) (2 points)

Im ok with it <3 Thank You Professor Ang this Semester was actually not considering the final and the grade an incredibly insightful one into computer science. This class alone has really helped me demystify game design and in a really weird way Computer Architecture, MC, MC Mods, and computers in MC. Point is that abstraction has become incredibly simple to reverse-engineer or decipher as a result of this class, and reading docs has never been so enjoyable. Thanks Again!
